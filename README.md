The problem Ethereum Track: Ilaaj solves
A major problem that most patient face is lack of confidentiality and leakage of personal documents. 
Also, in this pandemic situation, it is very difficult for doctors to meet and check-uptheir patients.
Ilaaj solves both of these problems while looking good at the same time ;).

Ilaaj is a blockchain based doctor-patient communication service that connects doctors and patients very securely. 
The app itself is a dashboard for doctors and patients both to manage their appointments and conversations. 
The app makes it possible (using RazonPay) to pay the doctor upfront before any consultation and hence eliminates the risks of frauds and scams.
But the real magic lies behind the iDMS - Ilaaj Document Management System. 
This is a highly secure DMS that stores all the records and prescriptions on a node on the ethereum blockchain on the Ropsten Test Server. 
This makes the documents rigid and maintains the assurance of good and safe document managing.
